#Pumpkin Asteroids
##Description
This is an adaptation of the classis game Asteroids. 
However, it is Halloween themed for the upcoming spooky season! 
In this game, instead of shooting the asteroids, you avoid them in order to capture the witch's hat and win the game.
##Purpose
This game was created for CSCI 3312 Intro to Game Development at Trinity University. 
The assignment called for a simple implementation of Asteroids....with a creative twist.
##Further Development
If I was to continue building this game, I would resolve the following bugs:
-weird asteroid movement
